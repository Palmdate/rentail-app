  <pre>Suggest 3 points for client to make the website better:
	
	 There are 3 points that I suggest:
	 
	 1. The clients need Admin Page. With this page, the clients can manage all request of </br>
	 rented building as soon as possible.
 	 Admin page has some feature: summary the request, sent and receive email from rented building,</br> 
	 update the status of building: is renting, available for rent or new,</br>
	 update information of building to the website on the easiest way.
	 
	 2. The website need has feature search with full options. It means that you can search available </br>
	 building/rooms depending on location/address, equipments, rentail fee, management fee and size of room.</br>
	 
	 3. The website can built the social network for renter. They can comments about the qualities, life style,</br
	 something you need improve or any things that the building has provided it well. </br>
	 This social will help everyone can evaluate and decide rent  it or not. Add addition, this can </br>
	 help the owner know the trend of renters.</pre>
